# Game-of-Life
An exercise in the Conway Game of Life algorithm.


[Conways' Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This software was an exploration in using SFML media libraries while
also being a pretty cool exploration of Conway's Game of Life cellular 
automation algorithm. I also did this to explore C++ in a bit more detail and
gain a better understanding of object oriented programming.

ToDo:
		Refine game window scale adjustments.
		Add wrap around to cells when they reach the edge of the window.
